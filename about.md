# Hi, I'm Yuto Imai 👋

I'm a **Vision and Language Researcher** and **Machine Learning Engineer** based in Japan, currently pursuing my Master's degree at Keio University. I'm passionate about developing intelligent systems that understand both vision and language, with real-world problem solving.

## 🚀 What I Do

I specialize in the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing:
- **Evaluation of MLLMs**: 
- **Multimodal AI**: Developing vision-language models that can understand and reason about both images and text
- **Cross-Modal Retrieval**: Building systems that can search for objects using natural language descriptions
- **Referring Expression Comprehension**: Enabling models to identify specific objects in images based on textual descriptions
- **Robotics Applications**: Applying multimodal AI to indoor navigation and object manipulation

## 🎯 Current Focus

- 🔬 **Research**: Working on panorama image VQA Benchmark for MLLMs
- 💼 **Professional**: Research intern at SB Intuitions Corp.
- 🌱 **Learning**: Exploring advanced applications of diffusion models and large language models in robotics

## 🏆 Highlights

- 📝 **Publications**: 6+ research papers in top AI/Robotics conferences (JSAI, RSJ, ICRA)
- 🏅 **Awards**: Winner of DialFRED Challenge @ CVPR 2023, multiple research excellence awards
- 🎯 **Recognition**: Top 1% research award from Japanese Robotics Society (800+ submissions)
- 🎓 **Education**: Master's at Keio University with significant scholarship support

> 💭 **Fun fact**: I'm probably one of the few researchers who can debug a neural network in the afternoon and run sound for a theater production in the evening! The skills actually complement each other more than you'd think.
